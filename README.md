# Turkish Earthquake Dashboard

Frontend client for the Turkey earthquake API I developed using Django Rest Framework:
https://github.com/eygul/turkey_earthquake_api  
https://ereny.pythonanywhere.com/quakes/latest/

Check out the website here:

## Features
- Interactive map using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap that pinpoints the earthquakes in the database and categorizes them based on their magnitude. Users can get more information about an earthquake by clicking on a pinpoint on the map.
- Live earthquake statistics using the data from my earthquake API and Chart.js.
- Listing of the last five earthquakes.
- Listing of all earthquakes in the database (in https://eygul.github.io/earthquake/all_quakes.html)
